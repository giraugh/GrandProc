#Lime Engine
Lime is an engine based around the love2D framework and a variant of [MoonScript](https://github.com/leafo/moonscript) called [MoonShine](https://github.com/retroverse/MoonShine). It is fast, flexible and easily customizable. It originally stemmed from my need for an engine which was quick to make prototypes in but also didn't limit you further down the road.

# Features:
* Simple variant of an ECS system; Jungle.
* Camera system (based of [Gamera](https://github.com/kikito/gamera))
* Input System using actions (Based of [Baton](https://github.com/tesselode/baton))
* External Online Console (uses [LoveBird](https://github.com/rxi/lovebird))
* Physics system (Uses [Bump](https://github.com/kikito/bump.lua) for collision detection and resolution)
* Console system
* Support for directory loading (over file loading)
* Inbuilt Maths library
* Level Loading (For Lime Editor)

__Lime__ uses a variant of the [moonscript](https://github.com/leafo/moonscript) language; [moonshine](https://github.com/retroverse/MoonShine).
It is more like [coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/) or python than Lua.
